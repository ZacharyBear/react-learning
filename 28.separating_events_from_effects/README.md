# Separating Events from Effects
- Event handlers run in response to specific interactions.
- Effects runs in synchronization is needed.
- Logic inside event handlers is not reactive.
- Logic inside Effects is reactive.
- You can move non-reactive logic from Effects into Effects Events.
- Only call Effect Events from inside Effects.
- Donâ€™t pass Effect Events to other components or Hooks.
