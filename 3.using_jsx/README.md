# Summary
- Tag and logic are closely related, so react put them in a `component`.
- **JSX** is similar to HTML, but there're some difference between these. In need, we could use [Translator](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx) to transfer HTML to JSX.
- `Error prompt` usually guide you to change the tags to the correct format.
