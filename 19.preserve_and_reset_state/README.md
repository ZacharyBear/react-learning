# Preserving and Resetting State
- React keeps state for as long as the same component is rendered at the same position.
- State is not kept in JSX tags. It’s associated with the tree position in which you put that JSX.
- You can force a subtree to reset its state by giving it a different key.
- Don’t nest component definitions, or you’ll reset state by accident.
