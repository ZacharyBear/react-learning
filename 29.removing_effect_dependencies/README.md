# Removing Effect Dependencies
- Dependencies should always match the code.
- When you’re not happy with your dependencies, what you need to edit is the code.
- Suppressing the linter leads to very confusing bugs, and you should always avoid it.
- To remove a dependency, you need to “prove” to the linter that it’s not necessary.
- If some code should run in response to a specific interaction, move that code to an event handler.
- If different parts of your Effects should re-run for different reasons, split it into several Effects.
- If you want to update some state based on the previous state, pass an updater function.
- If you want to read the latest value without “reacting” it, extract an Effect Event from your Effect.
- In JavaScript, objects and functions are considered different if they were created at different times.
- Try to avoid object and function dependencies. Move them outside the component or inside the Effect.
