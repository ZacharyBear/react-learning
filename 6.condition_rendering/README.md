# Summary
- At react, you could use JavaScript to control branch logics.
- You can use `if` statement to return value selectively.
- You can selectively assign some JSX values to variables, and then embed them into other JSXs using curly braces.
- You could use ternary operator to render JSXs. `{cond ? <A /> : <B />}` means "When `cond` is true, render `<A />`, otherwise render `<B />`. "
- `{cond && <A />}` means "When `cond` is true, render `<A />`, otherwise rendering nothing."
- Quick expressions are common, but if you prefer to use `if`, you can also avoid using them.
