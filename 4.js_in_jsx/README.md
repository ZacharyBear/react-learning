# JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces
Congratulations! Now you almost understand everything about JSX:
1. Value in quotes will be passed to attribute as a `string`.
2. Brace make you could bring `JavaScript` *logical* or *variables* to a tag.
3. They will take effect in the content area of the JSX tag or immediately after the ***=*** of attribute.
4. `{{` and `}}` are not special synctax, they're just `JavaScript Object` in JSX braces.
