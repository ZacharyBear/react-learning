# Synchronizing with Effects
- Unlike events, Effects are caused by rendering itself rather than a particular interaction.
- Effects let you synchronize a component with some external system (third-party API, network, etc).
- By default, Effects run after every render (including the inital one).
- React will skip the Effect if all of its dependencies have the save values as during the last render.
- You can’t “choose” your dependencies. They are determined by the code inside the Effect.
- Empty dependency array (`[]`) corresponds to the component “mounting”, i.e. being added to the screen.
- In Strict Mode, React mounts components twice (in development only!) to stress-test your Effects.
- If your Effect breaks because of remounting, you need to implement a cleanup function.
- React will call your cleanup function before the Effects runs next time, and during the unmount.
