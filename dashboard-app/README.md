# Dashboard UI
This is an awesome dashbard built with ReactJS. Follow original author: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA8Sxk_mHb8).

It’s an integrated version in this repository. I removed redundant css, js fragments, and make the code more clear.

## Skill Points you’ll meet:
- Media Query
- Grid Layout
- Root Variables
- Nesting CSS
- Reducer & Context
- SVG Attributes
  Make a circular progress bar with SVG APIs.
