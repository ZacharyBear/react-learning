# Extracting State Logic into a Reducer
- To convert from `useState` to `useReducer`:
  1. Dispatch actions from event handlers.
  2. Write a reducer function that returns the next state for a given state and action.
  3. Replace `useState` with `useReducer`.
- Reducers require you to write a bit more code, but they help with debugging and testing.
- Reducers must be pure.
- Each action describes a single user interaction.
- Use Immer if you want to write reducers in a mutating style.
