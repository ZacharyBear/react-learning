# Referencing Values with Refs
- Refs are an escape hatch to hold onto values that are’t used fo rendering. You won’t need them often.
- A ref is a plain JavaScript object with a single property called `current`, which you can read or set.
- You can ask React to give you a ref by calling the `useRef` Hook.
- Like state, refs let you retain information between re-renders of a component.
- Unlike state, setting the ref’s `current` value does not trigger a re-render.
- Don’t read or write `ref.current` during rendering. This makes your component hard to predict.
